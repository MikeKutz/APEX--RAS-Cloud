# Namespace Demo

Namespaces are to RAS as Contexts are to VPD.

Using the pair of Namespace and Attribute, you set or retrieve a VARCHAR2 value for the durration of a RAS Session. The function `dbms_xs_session.set_attribute` is used to set the value while `xs_sys_context()` is used to get the value. (`get_attribute()` can also be used)

Namespace values are tied to a RAS Session, whereas Contexts are tied to a DB Session.
That means: stateless applications (eg APEX) can set the value once for a RAS session and the value will remain that way for the entirety of the user's RAS session. Yes, the application can update the value durring a session. But, you don't have to set the value for every call like you do for Contexts.

Namespaces are unconstrained by default.  This gives anyone the ability to create the Namespaces in their RAS Session & update its attribute. (*note* Namespaces are created from a Namespace Template)

Namespaces can also be constrained to a specific ACL.
This limits the creation and modification of the Namespace to Principals with the specified ACL enabled. This includes code that enables the ACL through CBAC.

On the extreme end, the system privilege `ADMIN_ANY_NAMESPACE` allows the principal to create and modify a namespace irregardless of the ACL tied to it.
Like any other `ANY` privilege, you should limit its grants.

## Privilege Requirements
The requirement for the Privilege to be an intersect ( ‚à© ) of privileges still applies.

That is:  `Actual Privilege := DB Privilege ‚à© ACL Privilege ‚à© Security Class Privilege`

- `PUBLIC` already has the required DB Privileges to make and modify Namespaces
- The ACL should have `MODIFY_NAMESPACE` (to create the namespace) and `MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE` (to update its values).
  - The default ACL (the one used for unconstrained Namespaces) has these already
- Both ACL privileges are required to be part of a Security Class that has `sys.nstemplate_sc` as a parent.
  - Default ACL takes care of this too

## Integration Notes
Auto initialize in one of:
- Post Authentication Procedure of APEX (to confirm)
- Global Callback event `guest_to_user_event` for APEX (RAS Mode = Internal)
- Global Callback event `direct_login_event` for direct login users

## Scripts Description
The scripts have been tested on 21c ATP Free Tier.

Script | Run As | Constrained? | Description
---|---|---|---
`01-admin...` | ADMIN | init DB | creates users HR, DAUSTIN and grants appropriate privileges
`02-hr...` | HR | unconstrained | creates Namespace & init procedure
`03-daustin...` | DAUSTIN | unconstrained | demonstrates Namespace usage
`04-admin...` | ADMIN | constrained | creates DB Roles for CBAC use
`05-hr...` | HR | constrained | create Namespace & init procedures & GRANTs
`06-daustin...` | DAUSTIN | constrained | demonstrates Namespace usage and "illegal access"
`07-hr...` | HR | both | cleanup all HR generated objects

## Developer Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The constrained Namespace demo hits CVE-2023-21829. Patch your DB with CPU from 17-January-2023
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you don't try to create a Namespace that already exists. APEX can be DoS'd. (need verification)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Dictionary View for Global Callbacks does not seem to exist.
- üêú Make sure your Namespace is `UPPER()` (for non "xs$session" Namespaces) when you call `xs_sys_context()`
- üêú A code's granted role (CBAC) can be lost on `create or replace`. Reapply `grant` when developing.
- üìñ List of Events for the procedure `dbms_xs_session.add_global_callback` (and related procedures) do not match constants in the specification for `dbms_xs_session`
